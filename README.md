This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving the `useEffect` hook and state management.  The `useEffectBug.js` file shows the problematic code where a state variable is incorrectly modified outside of `setState`, leading to unexpected behavior. The `useEffectSolution.js` file provides the correct solution.  This issue is frequently encountered when working with asynchronous operations or timers within `useEffect` and failing to handle state updates within the cleanup function.
